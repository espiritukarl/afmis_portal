      "KADIWA rice to hit major public markets as DA pushes for lower prices",
    news: "The Department of Agriculture (DA) is set to roll out KADIWA Rice-for-All program in all major public markets to provide affordable options for consumers and curb persistently high retail prices of rice.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Francisco P. Tiu Laurel, Jr. said the move comes in response to the discrepancy between reduced tariffs on imported rice and the unusually high prices at the retail level.\n\n“Even with the tariff reduction, retail prices remain unusually high,” he said. “I have actual price bulletins of wholesale imported rice, and it’s really only at P37 to P38 per kilo. With lower tariffs and declining international prices, there’s no reason for the continued high retail prices.”\n\nSince the implementation of Executive Order No. 62 in July, which reduced rice tariffs from 35% to 15%, the DA has been actively engaging with importers and retailers to encourage price reductions. However, progress has been slow, prompting DA to take a more direct approach.\n\n“We’ve tried to avoid selling rice in major public markets to protect the livelihood of rice vendors,” the secretary noted. “But since they haven’t significantly lowered prices for well-milled and regular-milled rice, we are now forced to step in and offer KADIWA rice. This will allow us to supply consumers directly and compete with retailers.”",
