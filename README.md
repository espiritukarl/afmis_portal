# TECHSTACK  

## Frontend:  
- HTML
- CSS
- ReactJS
- Vite

## Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Database:
- MySQL

## Deployment:
- Frontend is temporarily hosted in Netlify
- Backend + Database has not been deployed yet

## Dependencies:
- gapi-script - Google API
- Highcharts + Highcharts-react-official
- React-big-calendar
- React-router
- mui

## Todo:
- Entire thing is SPA - might need to change depending on amount of data for other routes (I highly doubt this will be the case, but just in case)
- Entire backend + endpoints
- Database needs to be made - some from ICTS, some needs to be done in-house
- Dynamic display of data (currently, mock data is being used by the frontend)
